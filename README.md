# Gemma Translator

This repo was built with the assistance of [Google Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) and includes code to run an on-device, fully offline voice translator powered by [Gemma 4](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core) and [LiteRT-LM](https://github.com/google-ai-edge/LiteRT-lm). This fork replaces the web frontend with an Avalonia user interface on .NET, which draws on the panel of the appliance with no browser and no window manager. The speech-to-text part and the text-to-speech part call the Moonshine library in that same process, thus there is no API server. Text-to-speech is powered by [Moonshine](https://github.com/moonshine-ai/moonshine).

## Features

- **On-Device Inference**: Uses LiteRT-LM to run the `gemma4-e2b` model entirely locally. No internet required after setup.
- **Voice Interface**: Captures microphone audio, processes it, and sends it to the local model.
- **Optimized UI**: Retro-terminal styling custom-built for small hardware screens (like Raspberry Pi displays).
- **Unified Startup**: One script to launch the LLM server, the Python API, and the Avalonia user interface.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- .NET SDK 10 for `linux-arm64` — `deploy-pi.sh` makes sure that it is there
- Linux or macOS

## Required Hardware

- **Compute**: Raspberry Pi 5 with 8GB RAM
- **Audio Input**: Microphone or USB audio capture interface
- **Audio Output**: Speaker or headphone output device
- **Display**: Display monitor or touchscreen (e.g., 480x320 kiosk display)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Make Scripts Executable**
   Ensure the setup, download, start, and deployment scripts have execute permissions:
   ```bash
   chmod +x setup.sh download_model.sh start.sh deploy-pi.sh
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Run the setup script to create a Python virtual environment (`venv`) and install all required packages:
   ```bash
   ./setup.sh
   ```

3. **Download the Model**
   Run the model downloader script to fetch the `gemma4-e2b` model from Hugging Face and import it into LiteRT-LM:
   ```bash
   ./download_model.sh
   ```

## Running the Application

Start all services (LiteRT-LM and the user interface):
```bash
./start.sh
```

`--prod` and `-p` do nothing. The systemd unit gives `--prod`, and `start.sh`
takes it so that an old unit does not stop the appliance.

The user interface draws on the panel of the appliance. It is not a page, thus
there is no address for it. The two servers are here:

- **LiteRT-LM**: `http://localhost:9379`

## Raspberry Pi Appliance Deployment

To deploy as a permanent systemd kiosk service on a Raspberry Pi 5 (8GB):
```bash
./deploy-pi.sh
```
This automated script installs Debian audio/venv packages, sets up the Python environment, builds production UI assets, downloads the LiteRT model, and registers the systemd unit from `deploy/gemma-translator.service`.

## Project Structure

- `src/GemmaTranslator/` - the Avalonia user interface on .NET 10.
- `backend/` - `requirements.txt` only. It pins `litert-lm`, and `moonshine-voice` for the native speech library and the models that the C# software loads.
- `deploy/` - Parameterizable systemd service unit template (`gemma-translator.service`).
- `stl/` - STL files for 3D printing the hardware case.
- `setup.sh` - Automates Python virtual environment creation and dependency installation.
- `download_model.sh` - Fetches the required LiteRT model.
- `start.sh` - Multi-process launcher supporting `--prod` and development modes.
- `deploy-pi.sh` - One-command Raspberry Pi automated deployment script.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

The Gemma Translator supports **two keyboard modes**. Switch between them anytime from the **Settings panel → "Keyboard Mode"** dropdown. The choice is remembered across restarts (stored in the browser's `localStorage` under the key `keyboardMode`).

The app has two lanes (two people facing each other on the kiosk):
- **Lane 1 / Person 1** — the left/top lane.
- **Lane 2 / Person 2** — the right/bottom lane.

Each lane has a rotating language "revolver" and records speech, which is transcribed (Moonshine STT), translated (Gemma), and spoken back in the other lane's language (moonshine-voice TTS).

### Landscape Mode (default) — "active person"
One lane is the **active person** at a time. The active lane is framed with **corner brackets on all four corners**. You drive everything from a single set of keys and switch focus with Space.

| Key | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Spacebar** | Switch active person | Toggles the active lane (Person 1 ⇄ Person 2). Disabled while recording. |
| **Z** | Record (push-to-talk) | Hold to record the **active** person; release to transcribe & translate. |
| **← Left Arrow** | Previous language | Rotates the **active** person's language backward. |
| **→ Right Arrow** | Next language | Rotates the **active** person's language forward. |

Notes:
- The active lane shows four-corner brackets; while it is recording, the brackets invert to black along with the lane's color reversal.
- Best for one-handed / single-operator use.

### Vertical Mode — "two-hand" (original mapping)
Each lane has its **own dedicated keys** — there is no active-person concept and **no bracket highlight**. Both people can be controlled independently.

| Key | Action | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Z** | Record — Person 1 (push-to-talk) | Hold to record Lane 1; release to transcribe & translate. |
| **X** | Record — Person 2 (push-to-talk) | Hold to record Lane 2; release to transcribe & translate. |
| **← Left Arrow** | Previous language — Person 1 | Rotates Lane 1's language backward. |
| **→ Right Arrow** | Next language — Person 1 | Rotates Lane 1's language forward. |
| **− Minus** (`_`) | Previous language — Person 2 | Rotates Lane 2's language backward. |
| **+ Plus** (`=`) | Next language — Person 2 | Rotates Lane 2's language forward. |

Notes:
- No corner-bracket selection highlight in this mode.
- Best for two operators, each handling their own side.

### Common behavior (both modes)
- **Input focus guard:** all shortcuts are ignored while focus is on a configuration field (`<input>`, `<textarea>`, or `<select>`) — e.g. when editing the API endpoint or settings.
- **Recording lock:** language rotation is blocked while a recording is in progress.
- **Keyboard-driven:** recording and language rotation are keyboard-only in the current build; on-screen touch controls are not enabled.

### Switching modes
Open **Settings (⚙)** → **Keyboard Mode** → choose **Landscape** or **Vertical**. The change takes effect immediately and persists on the device.

| Setting value | Mode |
| :--- | :--- |
| `landscape` | Active-person scheme (Space / Z / ← →) — default |
| `vertical` | Two-hand scheme (Z / X / ← → / − +) |
